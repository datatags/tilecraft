# TileCraft
A Scratch 3.0 sandbox game where you can make a world with the many tiles available, and even make texture packs!

See the TileCraft studio at https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3650425/

The current stable version is TileCraft 2.0, the Ultimate Update.  It adds many new tiles, support for touch screen devices, better saving and importing, and more efficient code to make things easier to add on to later. 
See CHANGELOG for more details.
